  Every web page includes the following parts:

  a doctype tag
  an html element
  a head element
  a title element
  a body element


  Doctypes
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
All HTML documents require a doctype to tell the browser which version of HTML we are using. It must be the first line in the file. Without it, browsers will still show the document but may have unexpected results.



The html Element
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
The html tag is always the first tag in the document. It is the root or parent element. All other elements are stored or “nested” inside. The lang attribute classifies the language that the content will be in. Many lang values are available like fr for French or es for Spanish.


The head Element
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
The head element includes information about the page, but does not display content. Things like CSS, JavaScript, and metadata can be included here. The <title> is the only required tag inside of this element.


The title Element
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
The title element lives inside the <head> element. It sets the title of the page which is displayed at the top of the browser tab. Always include this in the <head>.

  The meta Element
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
The meta tag is used to set “metadata” (data about data) for a web page. There a number of uses for meta tags depending on the website. They live inside the <head> element of a web page.

The charset attribute defines the version of Unicode that we wish to use. UTF-8 is a common standard for handing the characters used in the world’s writing systems. Always include this in the <head> to avoid character display issues.


The body Element
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>

<p>This is a short paragraph</p>

<p>This is a longer paragraph. It
can include multiple sentences and
 span many lines.</p>
p is short for paragraph. It is used for longer blocks of text. There is no limit on length and it can include multiple sentences.

The div element
<div>
   <div></div>
</div>
 <div> elements can be nested inside other <div> elements as needed.
