        Living on Vancouver Island
I enjoy living on Vancouver Island because it has great lakes, river and mountains to explore. Summers get really hot and winters get very cold, but none the less thereâ€™s always something to do. I enjoy fishing and gardening in the summer and recently I have been getting familiar with hunting grounds. Hiking is something I would like to a lot more of for my physical activities to help ease into morning running. I have lived in different part of the Island although I do not think I would move off of the Island.
