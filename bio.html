<p>Living on Vancouver Island
I enjoy living on Vancouver Island because it has great lakes, river and mountains to explore. Summers get really hot and winters get very cold, but none the less there’s always something to do. I enjoy fishing and gardening in the summer and recently I have been getting familiar with hunting grounds. Hiking is something I would like to a lot more of for my physical activities to help ease into morning running. I have lived in different part of the Island although I do not think I would move off of the Island.
